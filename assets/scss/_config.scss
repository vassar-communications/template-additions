/*	Specific uses
	-------------

	The idea: some colors, in addition to being generic shades, also work best for certain circumstances. Using these variables instead of the actual color variable means:
	- the design is more consistently applied (say, one hover color for all buttons of type X, instead of different ones
	- it's more maintainable (if we realize that's not a good color, we can change it across the board)	
*/

//	This shade works best for hoverable elements that have a white background
